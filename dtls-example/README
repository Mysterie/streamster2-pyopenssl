WHAT IS THIS?
This is done to demonstrate how to encrypt a UDP channel using OpenSSL DTLSv1 support - DTLS implementation written by Nagendra Modadugu (nagendra@cs.stanford.edu) for the OpenSSL project 2005.

LIST OF FILES:

	Directory: common - Contains callback functions and error reporting functions common to client and server
		sslmgr.h
		sslmgr.c

	Directory: dtls_server
		dtls_server.c	- DTLS server part

	Directory: dtls_client
		dtls_client.c 	- DTLS client part

PREREQUISITES:
	It requires OpenSSL package version => 0.9.8a

DOCUMENTATION:
	This contains a simple DTLS client and DTLS server to show how to send UDP data over an encrypted channel. The client simply sends a string to the server and the server receives it after proper handshakes and prints it on stdout.
	Most parts of the server and client are respectively taken from apps/s_client.c and apps/s_server.c - Copyright (c) 1999-2005 The OpenSSL Project. For further help, please find it at 
	http://crypto.stanford.edu/~nagendra/projects/dtls/dtls.html

COMPILING:
	Untar the pack and simply do "make all". This will build both the server and client. The compiled binaries will be available in the appropriate source directories.

RUNNING the server/client:
	Before running dtls server and client, generate server and client certificates and place in the directories from where the server and client are gonna be executed.

	Command to generate server cert: dtls_server -s
	Server certificates details
		cert	: 	dtls.pem (RSA - 512)	
		key	:	dtls.key
		root CA	:	dtlsCA.pem
		DH file	:	dtlsDH.pem (512)
	
	Command to generate client cert: dtls_server -c
	Client certificate details
		cert	:	dtlsc.pem (RSA - 512)
		key	:	dtlsc.key
		root CA	:	Use the same one thatz used for server - dtlsCA.pem
