DTLS Spike:
- Packet Reliability & Retransmission?
	YES
- CBC MAC?
	Obligatoire.
- P2P compatibility?
	Not compatible with packets coming from IPs which are not the DTLS peer,
	e.g: 	A talks to B
		B talks to C
		C responds directly to A ==> DOESN'T WORK!
- Issues with Patch for renego: 0.9.8l doesn't work apparently
	We disable renegotiation
